# `flow-mono align-versions`

Compares all mono-repo packages with a dependency to `flow-bin` or `flow-typed` and prompts a automatic update that you can accept or decline on a per-dependency and package basis.

#### Features

* Makes maintaining the same `flow-bin` and `flow-typed` version across your mono-repo packages a bit easier.

#### Example

```sh
$ flow-mono align-versions
```
